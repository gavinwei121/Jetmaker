# Jetmaker
Jetmaker is an end-to-end framework designed to simplify the development of distributed systems in Python. It enables distributed Python applications to seamlessly access each other's services, resources, objects, and data, making inter-application interactions feel as though they are operating within the same environment. Jetmaker also provides powerful namespace sharing and synchronization tools, allowing distributed applications to work together as a unified, coordinated system.
